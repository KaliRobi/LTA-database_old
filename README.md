# LTA-database

First attempt to create an application around the Historical Database of Captives project. Python based version.

DBMS for Historical database of Captive
This is an older, but not suprisingly life long, project of a couple of PhD and graduate students in 2015. As it turned out there is a historical resource in the Hungarian Archives which recorded approx. 750 000 criminal accusations between 1932 and 1943. Each record kept the social-economic background of the accused person.This source is important for many fileds of researches, still, due to the mass of the records, processing takes time and effort. This is one of the reason why I decided to start this project. In short term the plan is to create an environment which provides a convenient platform  and country wide availability for researchers who are willing to contribute.
