# LTA-database

First Try to create an application around the Historical Database of Captives project. Python based version.

DBMS for Historical database of Captive
This is an older, but not suprisingly life long, project of a couple of PhD and graduate students in 2015. As it turned out there is a historical resource in the Hungarian Archives which recorded approx. 750 000 criminal accusations between 1932 and 1943. Each record kept the social-economic background of the accused person.This source is important for many fileds of researches, still, due to the mass of the records, processing takes time and effort. This is one of the reason why I decided to start this project. In short term the plan is to create an environment which provides a convenient platform  and country wide available for researchers who are willing to contribute.

Speaking of convenient... the html Ui pages at the moment are the bare minimum what i need for the backend. Memebers of the project 

 Obviously the project is also for my joy. To create something, enjoy and develope myself in Python, postgresql, frontend and IT infrastructure (AWS) at the same time.

##stages  between the <# #> stager are done: 

<#1. Input goes to an intermediate dict where the user can see/modify the input before sends it to the database.
1/a  mograte from sqlite to mysql to have more datatype and have chance for more complex analysis.  
   The test of this stage is performed by the old research team. #> 

2. GUI is needed to make it usable for others. In this stage a local database should be created which will make the upload possible via emails. 
   a. Flask and FLASKWTF is used to create the needed API-s
   b. logon system 
   b. grid styling on the css layer (looking for inspiring form ideas. Visual design is not my strong suit, they tend to say ...)

2.5 CRUD operations are working.
    WTforms validations are under progress
    Database(excel) serialization and migration to postgressql is under progress.
    This part is mostly cleared already but the database wont be migrated behind the database management app until mid march. 
    Until then I still have to serialize a couple of columns so the statistic template will be able to work with it.
    Some additional features: 
    operation recording table
    non-data based entry id and timestamp columns are needed in the main db.
    When these are ready the code app is good to go so stage 3 comes to be

3. the third stage will happen when the database and the front will be migrated to the AWS 
   a. AWS design is 'ready' Although it is tempting to build a decent (ALB-ELB <-> 2(or3) EC2 instance in autoscaling groups <-> RDS on postgres)  infrastructure at the moment EC2 price scaled spot instances and self-managed nginx and postgresql databases are the most possible. 
   
   
4. After the deployment there will be a 4 weeks long test period. During this time the team will try to challange the code. The task will be to eliminate bugs and  
   and find must-have features.
   This will be the period when the 'whats this all about', 'statistics', 'maps' pages will be populated. In this early period the most convenient way to show    some interesting data is to make the stat site capable of showing some basic but nifty stats of the settlements using pandas and seaborn.
